This is a fork of pyom by Davion at Mudbytes, which is in itself a rewrite of ROM 2.4 into python. The original ROM 2.4 was written in C in 1998, and from it were spawned most of the popular MUD engines we know today. 

ROM itself is overly simplistic by today's standards but provides a solid foundaton. In the spirit of pyom's goal to remain near feature parity with the original ROM codebase,  I have forked their project to provide a foundation for my own codebase. Nothing could be more in the tradition of Rivers of Mud, which was itself derrived from MERC, which was in turn derrived from DikuMud. 

My goal is to build on top of pyom a codebase not entirely different from those built on top of original ROM. I believe python to be a better language for rapid development and hope to implement a number of common systems over time.
